          Examples of wildcard actions include: `'user:*'`, `'function:*'`.

          Given an audit entry with an action of `'function:put'`, the
          following queries would result in a match:

            - `action=function:*`
            - `action=function:put`

          Given the same audit entry, the following query would not result in a match:

            - `action=function:get`

      description: |
        Returns the audit trail of calls to the HTTP APIs related to resources that belong to the account id.
        Each entry of the audit trail contains the timestamp of the call, resource, action, and the identity of the caller represented as the (issuer, subject) pair.
        Use query string parameters to filter the entries.

        All query filters are combined with a logical AND operator.

        By default, only the most recent 15 minutes of audit logs are returned. You can change this with the `from` query parameter.

            Search the metadata for functions that match this criteria.
            Each method has several different scopes that can be searched within, including `'compute'`, `'dependency'`, and `'tag'`.
            They correspond to values in the `compute` dependencies in the `package.json` and `metadata.tags` sections of the function specification.

            Search supports a single filtering criteria, in the form of `search=key` for any function possessing a key matching that value, or `search=key=value` for functions that specifically match a value.
            If the key or value contains an `=`, encode them to the URI specification first.

            Examples include `?search=compute.timeout=30`, `?search=dependency.ms=2.1.2`, `?search=tag.enabled`.

            Specifying `search` multiple times acts as a logical AND between the criteria, returning only functions that match all of the requested elements.

      properties:
        authorization:
          type: array
          description: |
            Use this property in conjunction with the `authentication` property. This property should not be used
            when `authentication` is `none` or undefined, because in those cases all callers will be allowed.

            If the caller is authenticated, you can use this property to only allow callers with specific
            permissions to invoke this function. You can also leave it undefined, which will allow all authenticated
            callers to invoke the function, without checking what permissions they have.

            The following example will only allow callers who have `function:execute` permission to the given subscription:
            `[{ action: "function:execute", resource: "/account/acc-5555555555555555/subscription/sub-5555555555555555/" }]`

            When the caller has been authorized, the `ctx.caller.permissions` property is set to the validated
            permissions of the caller. Otherwise, the property will be undefined.
          items:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/AccessStatement'
        authentication:
          description: |
            Controls the authentication of the caller of the function, based on the bearer token supplied in the
            `Authorization` header of the HTTP request.

            If the value is `none` or the property is undefined, then the `Authorization` header is not
            evaluated and the function is executed.

            If the value is `required`, the caller must supply a valid JWT trusted by Fusebit. If the token is
            present and valid, a check will be performed as described in the `authorization` property. If the
            check succeeds, the function will execute, the `ctx.fusebit.callerAccessToken` property
            will contain the supplied JWT, and the `ctx.caller.permission` property will contain the set of
            authorized permissions associated with the caller. If the check fails, a 403 Forbidden error response
            will be returned.

            If the value is `optional`, then the caller may supply a valid JWT trusted by Fusebit. If the token is
            present and valid, an authorization check will be performed as described in the `required` property
            description. If a token is not present, not valid, or fails the authorization check, the function executes
            as an unauthenticated user. This authentication option allows you to use Fusebit authorization for certain
            paths in your function, while implementing your own authorization for other paths.
          type: string
          enum:

          description: |
            In case a function needs to call Fusebit management APIs, the system can provide the necessary
            JWT via the `ctx.fusebit.functionAccessToken` property. The permissions of that token can be set using this
            property. For example, the following object will result in a token that has full control of all storage
            objects under the given subscription:
            `{ "allow": [{ "action": "storage:*", resource: "/account/acc-5555555555555555/subscription/sub-5555555555555555/" }] }`

            The function creator (the caller of this API) must have the same or broader permissions as what's being
            assigned here, as well as `function:put` for this function, otherwise the function creation will be rejected.

              status of the task execution can be queried. 

              If the number of requests pending execution exceeds `maxPending`, 
              an HTTP 429 response is sent and the request is not scheduled for execution.

              Unless an explicit `security` element is specified for this route, the HTTP POST
              requests that schedule task execution must be authorized with an access token that 
              grants the `function:schedule` action for the function resource.
