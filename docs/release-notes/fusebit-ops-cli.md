# Fusebit Operations CLI
{: .no_toc }
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The Fusebit operations CLI enables customers to create a private deployment of the Fusebit stack on their own cloud infrastructure. This can help address compliance, data locality and other concerns. The operations CLI does not apply to customers running on Fusebit public cloud infrastructure.

All public releases of the Fusebit Operations CLI are documented here, including notable changes made in every release. CLI releases follow the [Semantic Versioning 2.0 specification](https://semver.org/). For more information on the Fusebit versioning strategy, see [here](http://fusebit.io/docs/integrator-guide/versioning).
