## Version 1.15.3

- **Feature** Improve support for `async` functions with a new async-specific signature: `async (ctx)`,
  discarding the callback parameter.

  parameter, discarding any value returned from the function directly.

- **Improved performance of accessing the audit trail.** Optimized usage of indexes to improve performance of accessing filtered audit trail.

## Version 1.13.0

## Version 1.12.0
